### Abstract

This will be the most awesome paper ever.
The correlation between length and weight is a well-known pattern.
Here, we investigate this relationship in the endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (*Rana sierrae*).
You'll never believe what we find.
And those results are...

### Introduction

Many studies have described length-weight relationships in amphibians [@santini2018].
In the current study, we describe this relationship in the endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (*Rana sierrae*).

### Methods

xx

### Results

```{r}
#| include: false
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
d1 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "deso_capture.csv"))
```

In our study, we captured frogs from `r n_distinct(d1$site_id)` sites and made a total of `r nrow(d1)` length and weight measurements.
The length-weight relationship for *R. sierrae* is log-linear and does not differ between males and females (@fig-lenwt).
